#Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Class
===============================
This Repo contains the Getting and Cleaning Data Class Project. The data used is the data on Human Activity Recognition database

built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

The raw data is contained in zip file with several text files representing  test & train data and supporting files 


##The repo contains: 

-The R-script called "running_analysis.R" that can be used to download,unzip, read, map, merge and clean the data and get you from the raw data to the final tidydataset.

this script can be coppied into R. 


-The CodeBook which shows and details the steps taken from the original raw data to the tidy dataset. This should be used alongside the

R script above to get the data and guide you along the steps to the final product. It describes the process and shows the collumn header details.


The final tidydaset represents a summary on the participant and activity combination across the 86 mean and standard deviation

measured variables in the original dataset. The resulting dataset is a tidydataset of 88 collumns and 180 rows
